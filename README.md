# xml-actu

This repository contains an academic project focused on the creation, validation, querying, and transformation of an XML document named **actu.xml**.

The project demonstrates the use of XML-related technologies commonly used in data structuring and document processing.

## 📄 Project Content

- `actu.xml`  
  XML document describing news items (actualité).

- `actu.xsd`  
  XML Schema (XSD) used to validate the structure and data types of `actu.xml`.

  XSLT stylesheet used to transform the XML document into another format (HTML or structured text).

- `XPath.pdf`  
  Document containing XPath queries used to extract specific information from `actu.xml`.

## 🛠 Technologies Used

- XML
- XSD (XML Schema)
- XPath
- XSLT

## Features

- Validation of XML documents using XSD
- Data extraction using XPath expressions
- Transformation of XML documents using XSLT
- Structured and well-formed XML design

## Educational Objectives

- Understand XML document structure
- Apply schema-based validation
- Use XPath to navigate and extract XML data
- Transform XML documents using XSLT stylesheets

## Context

This project was developed as part of university practical work (Travaux Pratiques) in XML technologies.
